## Learnings 🧠

- **JavaScript event listeners:** I implemented JavaScript event listeners to make the buttons work.

- **Local storage:** I learned how to use local storage to store and retrieve data from the browser. I used this to save all notes data i.e. notes title and description.

- **Data manipulation:** I learned how to manipulate data using JavaScript. This included deleting, accessing and modifying data stored in local storage.

- **Functions:** I used functions to organize the code. This is a key concept in JavaScript, and it helped me to make my code more modular and easier to read.

- **Nesting:** I learned how to nest elements and functions in my HTML and JavaScript code. This was useful for organizing and structuring my code in a logical way.

- **Boostrap:** I have used bootstrap and CSS for styling of the JotPad webapp.
